# CBOE Put-Call Data Tool
### VBA on Excel To Automate Repetitive HTTP Requests With Parameters

## Functionality
This simple tool sends HTTP "GET" requests to the CBOE web site, downloads and parses the CBOE Put-Call Ratio data for the S&P 500 for a specific date. 
The above is repeated in a loop to construct the Put-Call Ratio historical data series.
Versions of the tool can be useful to automate repetitively obtaining online data for multiple parameters (dates, multiple URL addresses, etc.), such as in finance or banking.
