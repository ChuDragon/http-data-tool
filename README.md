# CBOE Put-Call Data Tool
### VBA on Excel To Automate Repetitive HTTP Requests With Parameters

## Functionality
This simple tool sends HTTP "GET" requests to the CBOE web site, downloads and parses the CBOE Put-Call Ratio data for the S&P 500 for a specific date. 
The above is repeated in a loop to construct the Put-Call Ratio historical data series.
Versions of the tool can be useful to automate repetitively obtaining online data for multiple parameters (dates, multiple URL addresses, etc.), such as in finance or banking.

## Developer: Roman Chuyan
It was developed for a client in VBA on Excel, as it's the host application.
The .xlsx workbook contains all the VBA code - just click the button to run, or modify the VBA macro. 
The app is also saved separately as .bas file. For custom modifications, contact me at the email in my profile.

## Setup/Dependencies
Microsoft XML, v6.0.
